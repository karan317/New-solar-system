# Project Description

We start by setting up a model of our Solar System, including the Sun and planets. For simplicity, all masses are considered point-like, and collisions are neglected. Constants are defined to make quantities dimensionless using cgs units.

#### Masses and Velocities

The masses, initial positions, and velocities of all the bodies in the Solar System are defined. Data is sourced from the NASA Planetary Fact Sheet.
N-Body Equations

The function for the N-body equations is defined to provide the derivatives used for integration.

#### Integration

The equations are integrated over a timespan of 100 years, taking 5000 steps.

#### Visualization

3D positions of the bodies in the Solar System after 100 years are plotted.

## Adding a Second Star

A second star with the same mass as the Sun is introduced, and its parameters are defined. The new system is integrated over a timespan of 25 years.
New Visualization

The new positions of the bodies in the Solar System, including the second star, are plotted.
